This is a simple path tracer based on [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). In addition, frames are rendered in parallel and camera motion is animated.

## Rendering a video
1. Optional: Edit the world and camera motion in `Setup.cs`.
2. Run `make`.
3. Find the video file in the `render_output` directory.
